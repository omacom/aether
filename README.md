# Aether

A visual theming application for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). Extract colors from wallpapers and apply cohesive themes across your entire desktop.

> **Not using Omarchy?** Aether works standalone on any Linux desktop. See the [Standalone Guide](docs/standalone.md) for setup.

## Features

### Color Extraction
- Pure Go median-cut algorithm that generates a full 16-color ANSI palette from any wallpaper
- 8 extraction modes: Normal, Monochromatic, Analogous, Pastel, Material, Colorful, Muted, and Bright
- 12 fine-tuning sliders (vibrance, contrast, temperature, shadows, highlights, and more)
- Light and dark mode toggle with automatic color anchor swapping

### Wallpaper Tools
- Search and download wallpapers from wallhaven.cc directly in the app
- Browse public GitHub repositories for wallpapers
- Export favorite wallpapers as a ZIP archive with source metadata
- Apply a blurred wallpaper variant while extraction uses the original image
- Full wallpaper editor with blur, exposure, sharpen, vignette, grain, and color toning
- 12 one-click image presets: Cinematic, Vintage, Film, Dramatic, and more

### Theme Library
- 24 built-in color presets including Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, and Sakura
- Import 250+ community Base16 color schemes
- Save and restore complete themes as blueprint files
- Export themes as shareable packages with selective app inclusion
- Keep the palette-matched Yaru icon default or choose an installed desktop icon theme per blueprint

### Application Support
- 20+ pre-configured apps: Hyprland, Waybar, Kitty, Alacritty, Ghostty, Neovim, VS Code, Zed, btop, and more
- Template system with hex, RGB, RGBA, and stripped format modifiers
- Per-app overrides, reload hooks, and post-apply scripts
- Add your own apps with custom templates

### Extras
- WCAG contrast ratio checker with AAA/AA accessibility grading
- Gradient generator and single-color palette builder
- 50-step undo/redo history
- Headless CLI for scripting, keybinds, and automation

## Quick Start

### Install (Arch Linux)

```bash
yay -S aether
```

### Install (Debian / Ubuntu)

Download the `.deb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/omacom/aether/releases/latest):

```bash
sudo dpkg -i aether_*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S go webkit2gtk

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev

git clone https://github.com/omacom/aether.git
cd aether && make build
```

### Basic Usage

1. Select a wallpaper (drag & drop, file picker, or wallhaven browser)
2. Click **Extract** to generate a color palette
3. Adjust colors as needed
4. Click **Apply Theme**

### Desktop Icon Themes

Use the compact **Icons** control directly below **Light mode** in the editor sidebar. Its switch enables or disables the existing Icons target, while the selection opens the installed-theme chooser. **Automatic** preserves Aether's color-matched Yaru output. An explicit choice writes the installed theme's directory ID; if that theme is later uninstalled, Aether keeps the saved ID and marks it as missing instead of silently replacing it. Disabling Icons omits `icons.theme` without erasing the choice.

The picker searches the standard user and system XDG icon roots and the legacy `~/.icons` root. **Refresh** rescans after you install a theme. Aether does not download or install icon themes.

## CLI

```bash
aether --generate ~/wallpaper.jpg
aether --apply-blueprint "My Theme"
aether --list-blueprints
```

See `aether --help` for all options.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omacom/aether.git
cd aether

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Run in development mode (hot reload)
wails dev

# Build production binary
wails build
```

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.25+, Node.js 22.22.2+ or 24.15+ LTS, [Wails v2](https://wails.io), webkit2gtk, gtk-layer-shell, gstreamer, gst-plugins-good

### Verification

Run `make test` for the Go package tests. With the native build dependencies installed, `go test -race -tags webkit2_41 ./...` also covers the app entry points and enables Go's race detector (omit the tag on WebKitGTK 4.0 systems).

From `frontend/`, run `npm ci`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. The frontend regression suite uses mocked Wails calls, so it does not change your desktop. Use `make dev` for manual verification of native dialogs, rendering, and theme application.
