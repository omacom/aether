# Wallpaper Editor

Edit your wallpaper with professional filters before extracting colors.

## Opening the Editor

1. Load a wallpaper in the Palette Editor
2. Click the **edit icon** (pencil) next to the Extract button
3. The full-screen editor opens

## Source-preserving blur

Use `Heavy blur wallpaper` in the main wallpaper preview to select a blurred desktop variant.
The wallpaper editor and color extraction continue to use the original image.
Use `Remove blur` to select the original image again.

Blueprints store the source path and the blur choice.
Aether recreates the cached variant when needed.
Saved theme folders contain both the original image and the blurred variant.

## Wallpaper-only changes

On Omarchy, use `Wallpaper only` in Local, Wallhaven, or Favorites to change the background.
This action preserves the active theme and its colors.
It requires Omarchy's public background command.
